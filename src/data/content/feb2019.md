# My BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe is more economical now?
###### 3 February 2019

Great cars like the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe 2.0 420i M Sport (Professional Media) 16v (184bhp) Hatchback 5dr 1998cc Petrol Automatic (8 Speed) Petrol Automatic jump out to me when I am checking environment data. This one has changed, so I type it here. I get a lot of these changes.

Many large organisations such as CD Bramall, Perrys, Lombard, Lex, Pendragon, Network, BMW Finance, Citroen Finance, and Renault UK and many other suppliers queue up to make their cars available to me at LINGsCARS.com because they know they will benefit from a supply of ready and waiting quality customers, fast sales and efficient communications.

Compared to improvements in the emissions of toxic pollutants, there has been less progress on reducing CO2 from cars. For a given type of fuel the CO2 emissions of a car are directly proportional to the quantity of fuel consumed. Until recently the average fuel consumption of new cars was unchanged relative to that in the mid 1980ï¿½s. This was because while engines have become more efficient over this period, average vehicle mass has increased due to additional features to meet crash safety requirements and the widespread addition of features such as power assisted steering and air conditioning. However, there are signs that in the last few years average fuel consumption has begun to drop in response to voluntary agreements by vehicle manufacturers to reduce CO2 emissions.

Working it out from the tables, the CO2 is just 134g/km for the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe Petrol Automatic. There are a few cars in this range, so different specs will give slightly different CO2 values.

My BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe 2.0 420i M Sport (Professional Media) 16v (184bhp) Hatchback 5dr 1998cc Petrol Automatic (8 Speed) Petrol Automatic gearbox is only £393.46 inc VAT per month with 3 months initial payment, followed by 35 payments on direct debit. Business customers, make sure you deduct the VAT, when making decisions. As I can’t tell what type of customer you are (business or private), I can’t display the price any other way but to show VAT seperately (sorry!).

This price on my BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe includes full road tax for the length of the contract, on all of my cars and vans! Free delivery to your home or work and free collection from you at the end! £393.46 inc VAT per month is based on you driving 10,000 miles per annum, but higher mileages are usually available at a small extra cost. If you go over the allocated miles, you can pay a small excess mileage charge, usually between 3p and 15p per mile.

# Hydrocarbon results for the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe have changed

CO2 CO2, CO2. It always seems to go up. The BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe 2.0 420i M Sport (Professional Media) 16v (184bhp) Hatchback 5dr 1998cc Petrol Automatic (8 Speed) Petrol Automatic seems to have reversed this trend. If you choose one of these, you will be pleased. Lower CO2 means lower fuel consumption.

With my deals, you get a brand new car with zero miles on the clock, delivered to your door. The new car is fully taxed and has the full manufacturer’s warranty and AA cover. It has proper New Car Smell; you know this smell? MMMMM!

And if you are thinking that all the fuss at the moment should be about air travel, not cars, Michael O’Leary (of Ryanair) will put you right. He said “Aviation accounts for a ‘Mickey Mouse’ 3% of carbon emissions across the EU, compared with nearly 25% from road transport” He also said “I donï¿½t believe in trotting out all that PC claptrap just not to upset a couple of fu*king environmental lunatics. They are just loons” – which makes sense to me, as I have a problem with this statement from Christopher Macgowan, the head of the SMMT; “The motor industry is committed to helping tackle climate change”. Frankly, I don’t think many retailers and dealers are.
