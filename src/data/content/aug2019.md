# My Renault Kangoo Ze CO2 g/km levels

Updating the Renault Kangoo Ze ZEV (60bhp) ZE ELECTRIC ML20 44kW 33kWh Business Van Electric Auto 1cc Electric Automatic quickly is brilliant because Google loves to use me as the choice for listing these cars.

I am determined to create momentum in this dinosaur industry to make it aware of environmental responsibilities. Please ask your local dealer what additional steps they are taking. Please be aware of their advertising, their business methods and their environmental impact and question them; “What are you doing to exceed the legal minimum requirements?”.

I have taken a typical model of this car from my website – the Renault Kangoo Ze Electric Automatic. For this car, the CO2 is now just 119g/km. Other trim levels might differ slightly.

My [Renault Kangoo Ze ZEV (60bhp) ZE ELECTRIC ML20 44kW 33kWh Business Van Electric Auto 1cc Electric Automatic](https://www.lingscars.com/personal-car-leasing/renault/kangoo-ze-/3442166-ZEV-(60bhp)-ZE-ELECTRIC-ML20-44kW-33kWh-Business-Van-Electric-Auto-1cc) gearbox is only £200.58 inc VAT per month with 6 months initial payment, followed by 23 payments on direct debit. Business customers, make sure you deduct the VAT, when making decisions. As I can’t tell what type of customer you are (business or private), I can’t display the price any other way but to show VAT seperately (sorry!).

This price on my Renault Kangoo Ze includes full road tax for the length of the contract, on all of my cars and vans! Free delivery to your home or work and free collection from you at the end! £200.58 inc VAT per month is based on you driving 10,000 miles per annum, but higher mileages are usually available at a small extra cost. If you go over the allocated miles, you can pay a small excess mileage charge, usually between 3p and 15p per mile.

Sir Nicholas Stern, Head of the Government Economics Service, produced the UK Government Environmental Report on the Economics of Climate Change. I was so pleased to win an Environmental Award in 2008, myself. I am determined that LINGsCARS.com will go further than anyone else in this industry to exceed the legal minimum information disclosure. It is probably the case that my customers have the smallest environmental footprints of any new car customers in the UK!

# My Mercedes E Class Coupe CO2 g/km levels

Fuel is a fortune these days, so when the Mercedes E Class Coupe 2.0 E220d 16v (194bhp) AMG Line Premium Coupe 2dr 1950cc Diesel Automatic has slightly changed figures, I always blog about it, because my customers say they care.

Personal Contract Hire is exactly the same as contract hire for businesses. This is the beauty of getting a car like this, as you benefit from FLEET BONUSES! However, VAT makes a difference. Businesses get the rentals shown ex-VAT (they can often reclaim half of it), whereas private purchasers have it included in the rentals.

If showroom-based car dealers fail to show fuel consumption labels on new cars on display, or to make available to potential buyers the results of the fuel consumption tests as listed in this booklet, it renders them liable on conviction to a fine of up to ï¿½5,000. This is why dealers miraculously acheive these “minimum standards” – under threat of a ï¿½5,000 fine!

Working it out from the tables, the CO2 is just 119g/km for the Mercedes E Class Coupe Diesel Automatic. There are a few cars in this range, so different specs will give slightly different CO2 values.

Winning the environmental award (2008 Best Environmentalist in the car industry) was very pleasing for me as it meant I was being recognised for my hard work. I’m the the ONLY new car supplier to display and promote environmental info for ALL new cars, on the web! Please note I have pioneered availability of environmental information on the internet. Using the internet to research and buy new cars is the most environmentally friendly method, by miles.
