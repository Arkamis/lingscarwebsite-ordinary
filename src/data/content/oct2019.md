# My Mercedes C Class Coupe has been updated
###### 2 January 2019

CO2 affects fuel consumption directly. Less CO2 means less fuel burnt. So, I’m reporting this change on the [Mercedes C Class Coupe Petrol Automatic](https://www.lingscars.com/personal-car-leasing/mercedes/c-class-coupe/3383650-1.5-C200-AMG-Line-16v-(198bhp)-(4-seats)-Coupe-2dr-1497cc-Petrol-9G-Tronic-(9-Speed)). Have a look at the new figures.

Your car belongs to the finance company on whose documents you agreed to the contract. Many different wear and tear agreements are issued, but it is safe to say that they all are similar to the industry standard issued by the BVRLA (British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association). I have condensed the advice into an easy to read PDF file. If you have things to fix, I recommend 1st call to people like Dent Devils, mobile Glass Repair, etc. Cheap and often works. They usually come to you, in van. Easy. Treat this car like your own car and you will not go far wrong. If you sold a 2-year-old car privately, you would fix exact same problems. Common sense helps!

Christopher Macgowan, Chief Executive of the SMMT wrote to me and said “Ling, thank you very much for giving us the opportunity at SMMT to look at the impact of the (environmental) label in a different media from the car showroom. We have always been aware that like the “white goods” label on which the car label is based, that its merits extend beyond the car showroom. In addition we know that the earlier in the buying process the purchaser thinks about low CO2 emissions the more consideration it will be given in the buying process. The industry is committed to seeing the environmental credentials of cars being widely publicised and the SMMT will continue to provide leadership in this area; as with all new initiatives in a huge industry like ours, it takes a bit of time to become widespread and universally available but please be in no doubt that the SMMT and I personally are determined to see the widespread use of the new label.”

For this brand new M[ercedes C Class Coupe Petrol Automatic](https://www.lingscars.com/personal-car-leasing/mercedes/c-class-coupe), the latest CO2 figure is just 140g/km. When I chose this trim, it was because I have a few of these available. Different trims will have different CO2.

My [Mercedes C Class Coupe 1.5 C200 AMG Line 16v (198bhp) (4 seats) Coupe 2dr 1497cc Petrol 9G-Tronic (9 Speed) Petrol Automatic](https://www.lingscars.com/personal-car-leasing/mercedes/c-class-coupe/3383650-1.5-C200-AMG-Line-16v-(198bhp)-(4-seats)-Coupe-2dr-1497cc-Petrol-9G-Tronic-(9-Speed)) gearbox is only £346.68 inc VAT per month with 6 months initial payment, followed by 35 payments on direct debit. Business customers, make sure you deduct the VAT, when making decisions. As I can’t tell what type of customer you are (business or private), I can’t display the price any other way but to show VAT seperately (sorry!).

In 1993 exhaust emission limits, (generally referred to as the Euro 1 standards) were introduced for new cars which resulted in the adoption of advanced emission control techniques, e.g. catalysts. More stringent emission limits came into effect in 1997 (Euro 2) and 2001 (Euro 3) and 1st January 2005 (Euro 4). Euro 4 came fully into force on 1st January 2007 and now covers most new cars on sale.

# Comparative label for the Mercedes C Class Saloon
###### 25 May 2019

	

Checking against the values I publish for the Mercedes C Class Saloon 1.5 C200 SE (197bhp) Saloon 4dr 1497cc Petrol 9G-Tronic (9 Speed) Petrol Automatic, I have noticed a small error, so I’m publishing these new figures today. Please read.

Physical stock is always limited, as cars cannot be made to appear by magic, there are only so many sat in corner of field. So be brave, grab a bargain and avoid me having to make phone calls to disappointed people who have left decision too late. Remember that you have to pass finance before I can reserve you a car, so allow time for that!

My customers agree to adhere to a fixed mileage allowance (usually 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 miles per annum) and they are charged for “excess” miles. This means they are far more aware of the costs involved in unneccessary journeys in their new cars. To a certain extent, my customers will consider “is my journey really neccessary?” and “would it be cheaper to do this long trip on the train?”.

For this brand new Mercedes C Class Saloon Petrol Automatic, the latest CO2 figure is just 140g/km. When I chose this trim, it was because I have a few of these available. Different trims will have different CO2.

My Mercedes C Class Saloon 1.5 C200 SE (197bhp) Saloon 4dr 1497cc Petrol 9G-Tronic (9 Speed) Petrol Automatic gearbox is only £293.69 inc VAT per month with 3 months initial payment, followed by 35 payments on direct debit. Business customers, make sure you deduct the VAT, when making decisions.

# Toxic gases on the Mercedes GLA Class
######  31 October 2018

CO2 affects fuel consumption directly. Less CO2 means less fuel burnt. So, I’m reporting this change on the Mercedes GLA Class Petrol Automatic. Have a look at the new figures.

You run this new car for 12, 18, 24 or 36 months depending on the term, and run it within an agreed mileage limit (usually 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 miles per year, but different mileages are possible). If you exceed the mileage limit, you pay for extra miles at (typically) 4p – 10p per extra mile. This is known as the excess mileage rate.

My customers drive brand-new cars. These cars are far less polluting than cars built just a few years ago. As an extreme example, it would take 50 new cars to produce the same emissions per kilometre as a vehicle made in 1970. The new cars my customers are driving have been produced on the most modern production lines, using the latest technology with much lower environmental build costs than cars produced in the past. By their nature, these new cars will be emitting the lowest levels of pollutants than they will ever produce in their lifetimes, as they get older.

I am pleased to say that the CO2 for the Mercedes GLA Class Petrol Automatic is now g/km. If you chose a different trim level, the CO2 would change, but not by much.
