# Pollutant levels on my Renault Kangoo Ze


Looking at my records, the [Renault Kangoo Ze ZEV (60bhp) ZE ELECTRIC ML20 44kW 33kWh Business Van Electric Auto 1cc Electric Automatic](https://www.lingscars.com/personal-car-leasing/renault/kangoo-ze-/3442166-ZEV-(60bhp)-ZE-ELECTRIC-ML20-44kW-33kWh-Business-Van-Electric-Auto-1cc) has changed today, so I have updated the environmental information on my website. You have to laugh that I can beat Renault to this update!.


With my deals, you get a brand new car with zero miles on the clock, delivered to your door. The new car is fully taxed and has the full manufacturer’s warranty and AA cover. It has proper New Car Smell; you know this smell? MMMMM!.

On new cars for example, average CO2 has been cut by more than 10 per cent in six years. Improvements at manufacturing sites have been more significant. Published in September, the SMMT’s seventh annual sustainability report showed that average energy used ï¿½ and CO2 emitted – to produce each vehicle in the UK has been halved in just four years.

I am pleased to say that the CO2 for the Renault Kangoo Ze Electric Automatic is now 119g/km. If you chose a different trim level, the CO2 would change, but not by much.

My Renault Kangoo Ze ZEV (60bhp) ZE ELECTRIC ML20 44kW 33kWh Business Van Electric Auto 1cc Electric Automatic gearbox is only £202.21 inc VAT per month with 6 months initial payment, followed by 23 payments on direct debit. Business customers, make sure you deduct the VAT, when making decisions. As I can’t tell what type of customer you are (business or private), I can’t display the price any other way but to show VAT seperately (sorry!).

This price on my [Renault Kangoo Ze](https://www.lingscars.com/personal-car-leasing/renault/kangoo-ze-) includes full road tax for the length of the contract, on all of my cars and vans! Free delivery to your home or work and free collection from you at the end! £202.21 inc VAT per month is based on you driving 10,000 miles per annum, but higher mileages are usually available at a small extra cost. If you go over the allocated miles, you can pay a small excess mileage charge, usually between 3p and 15p per mile.

Remember I won the best non-franchise environmentalist 2008 in the Automotive Industry Awards. Don’t let these manufacturers fool you; [LINGsCARS website](https://www.lingscars.com) is the ONLY new car supplier to display and promote environmental info for ALL new cars, on the web! I have a Master’s Degree in Environmental Quality from Bournemouth Univeristy in 2000, plus a BSc in Applied Chemistry from Jinan University, Guanzhou in 1997.

# New VCA data on the VW Tiguan Allspace Estate

Fuel is a fortune these days, so when the [VW Tiguan Allspace Estate 2.0 TDI SEL 16v (150bhp) (7 seats) Estate 5dr 1968cc Diesel DSG Speed) Diesel Automatic](https://www.lingscars.com/personal-car-leasing/vw/tiguan-allspace-estate/3438409-2.0-TDI-SEL-16v-(150bhp)-(7-seats)-Estate-5dr-1968cc-Diesel-DSG-Speed)) has slightly changed figures, I always blog about it, because my customers say they care.

Sometimes you must resign yourself to fact that dealer will look after a retail customer first. Your delivery might be slightly delayed because they are fussing over a damn retail customer (paying ï¿½1000’s more than you), and you have to learn to relax. Most times these delays never happen, but sometimes they do, so I’m just preparing your brain and giving you tip.

Martin Callanan (Euro MP for the North East Region) said “Ling and her unique website LINGsCARS.com displays environmental information in a way that leads the UK motor industry. Following my discussions with her about greening the business, Ling has grasped the environmental nettle and is giving UK car buyers comprehensive environmental data on all new cars for sale in the UK to enable them to make an informed choice. LINGsCARS.com gives a fantastic amount of green information on her new cars, which the rest of the UK motor industry would do well to emulate. Using the internet is already the most energy efficient way of researching and buying a new car, so well done Ling for taking the personal responsibility to push this carbon data to the top of her agenda and to push environmental awareness a big step further”

Working it out from the tables, the CO2 is just 132g/km for the VW Tiguan Allspace Estate Diesel Automatic. There are a few cars in this range, so different specs will give slightly different CO2 values.

My VW Tiguan Allspace Estate 2.0 TDI SEL 16v (150bhp) (7 seats) Estate 5dr 1968cc Diesel DSG Speed) Diesel Automatic gearbox is only £344.78 inc VAT per month with 6 months initial payment, followed by 35 payments on direct debit.

The comparative or “fridge” label, is compulsory in car showrooms – except you’ve got to DRIVE there to see it! I won an industry award for displaying it electronically for all website visitors. I am the proud winner of the 2008 Best Environmentalist 2008 Automotive Management Award. Like me, Michael O’Leary, CEO of Ryanair talks straight about cars versus planes. “The usual horseshit”, he says. One day, every car will be as Green as my Jolly Green Nuclear Missile Truck “Calm down dear!” – it’s only done 1,000 miles since 1970.

# Fuel economy and CO2 change on my Nissan Navara

Local franchised dealer will sort out any warranty problems for free, but on most contracts (except VW group) any VAT registered garage can service car very cheap. Don’t use manufacturer agents, they are damn expensive. You never have an MOT (except on occasional 3-year contracts), car is always too young.

I am pleased to say that the CO2 for the Nissan Navara Diesel Manual is now 119g/km. If you chose a different trim level, the CO2 would change, but not by much.

My Nissan Navara 2.3 dCi 16v (190bhp) Double Cab Tekna TT 4WD Pickup 2298cc Diesel Manual gearbox is only £307.30 inc VAT per month with 6 months initial payment, followed by 35 payments on direct debit.

EU Directive 1999/94/EC requires new car fuel consumption and CO2 emissions data to be made freely available to consumers. Car dealers are required to have a label showing the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of each different model on display, either on or near the vehicle. Fuel consumption figures will be expressed both in litres per 100 kilometres (l/100 km) and in miles per gallon (mpg). The label will list the figures achieved in urban, extra-urban and combined conditions separately. From September of 2005, dealers had the option to produce a new “comparative” label. The new label shows the mandatory Fuel Consumption and CO2 figures mentioned previously, alongside information about the appropriate VED band for the vehicle. The new label is similar in design to the energy efficiency labels that appear on many ‘white goods’, such as fridge freezers
