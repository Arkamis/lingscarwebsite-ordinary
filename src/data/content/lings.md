# Hello! I am Ling!

I'm the UK's **hardest working** car leasing provider, and I run **LINGsCARS, the UK's _favourite_ car leasing website.** 


**Don't be deceived...** I may be a scruffy Chinese girl, but I have more happy new-car customers and supply more new cars than many of the anonymous (and some big-name!) leasing companies out there, combined.
2008 = £35million of new cars at retail price

## I treat customers like adults, not like idiots.

## An interview with Ling Valentine

### Interesting name Ling, where are you from?

I'm Chinese, from Chengdu in the People's Republic. I married Jon Valentine in 1997 iIn Helsinki. I was in Finland doing a Master's degree (in Finnish!!!), when I met Jon. He's English. He said Valentine is a Scottish-Jewish name, but he's from Yorkshire. He talks rubbish... :).


I am full-time LINGsCARS business owner and I specialise in supplying new UK Contract Hire, (and sometimes PCP, Lease cars and Lease Hire) cars and vans. LINGsCARS consumes my life to make it a very successful business. In 2008, I moved over £35,000,000 of brand new cars!


### Do you still visit China?

Yes, my family is mostly in China. My mum and dad still live in Chengdu, Sichuan, and I go back at least once every year. China is coming on, you know! Although the political situation is rotten, it's stable and my family have a good life. My mum's a famous dentist (over 70 but still working!), and my dad used to work for the government in the Environmental Service, but he's retired now.


My sister Shan works for the Sichuan Poverty Relief Office, but in the Cultural Revolution, she used to be a red guard! I'm too young to have been involved in all that rubbish. China's quite polluted, and not as green as the UK... plus there are so many people everywhere there. Life is more pleasant here...and I've been naturalised now. I guess that makes me Chinglish. I am a successful immigrant at least! I did it legally, and I have succeeded. That puts a smile on my face.

### Where did you learn your contract hire car sales skills?

My husband set up Caledonia Contracts, then established Arena Contracts in London before he went to work for himself. He was very successful, so I learnt the business and took over the reins. I must say I'm better at it than him! The key to this business is efficiency. This means that I give a very good personal service, I have very few overheads to add to the cost of the cars, plus I have a fully computerised system that I built myself, that I am developing all the time. Computers and databases are my hobby. I live on the internet. I consider myself to be the equivalent of Ryanair, in the Contract Hire business. In January 2006, FLEET NEWS, the car fleet operator's trade newspaper said; "(Ling is...) contract hire's Ryanair".

[My business](https://www.lingscars.com) gives better service than larger, posher businesses, but I have lower overheads, offer cheaper prices and do more business; and the end result is that people can rent exactly the same cars for less. I spend a lot of my time finding the best deals in the UK, then cutting out most of the larger companies' costs so that my cars are the UK's cheapest, and my service is simply the best.

I have over[ 1000 customer letters published](https://www.lingscars.com/letters). In 2008, customer Alan Johnston wrote: **_"The most efficient business I have ever dealt with. Everything done so professionally. Kept totally informed step by step. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending LINGsCARS to anyone."_**

### What about all the press and publicity you generate?

![Ling report of participation on Dragon's den T.V show](https://www.lingscars.com/images/ling/dragons_den.jpg "BBC report of Ling's participation") 

Oh, well, this is a bit of a story, but briefly... I like to publish everything I do on the internet. After getting massive publicity for my Nuclear Missile Truck, the **BBC contacted me for Dragons' Den.**

I really enjoyed doing the show and turned down their offers of investment (mainly because the % investment they wanted was so high), but also because I am not desperate for cash. Following Dragons' Den, I appeared on lots of other TV and radio, and now run successful TV advert campaigns.

I have also been one of the subjects of a BBC book, and have loads of other invitations for press and publicity opportunities. I make loads of small, fun films... you can see [them on this section of the website](https://www.lingscars.com/movies), and I am often invited to write editorial for things like business directories and blogs. I guess people like a different take on things.

### Who are your suppliers?

Oh, I use many large motor supply companies, and I make them compete for my business. You see, they know that they get pre-screened, computer generated information that enables them to do their jobs so quickly and easily that they seem willing to pass more of their savings on to me. It's amazing that many companies in this business still work with illegible, handwritten, incomplete and incorrect information on paper forms and they pass this amongst themselves until they have generated no end of problems. My system is as perfect and as simple as I can make it, and I seem to reap the rewards. **My customers get the savings I make passed on to them**. I often make my money out of _bulk business bonuses_ that mean that I don't need to make 1p on the cost price of a car. So simple, but so hard for other firms, it seems. Am I giving away my secrets? I'd better stop...
